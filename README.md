# Workflow Management Software


Created a software package that's perfect for small businesses. It does a lot of important things like - 
1. Managing 'how' and 'who' can use it (Role-Based). 
2. Giving out tasks to employees. 
3. Handling employee pay (Payroll Management). 
4. Managing HR stuff.
5. Easier to management / track client. 

All these features are in one place, making work smoother.

What's cool about this software is that it's scalability; the software can easily add new things. 
Also added tools from Amazon and Firebase to make talking to clients even better and keep everything secure. 
This software is a big help for small businesses, making their work easier and more organized in today's fast-changing business world.
